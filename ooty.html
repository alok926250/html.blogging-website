    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Away from Home-Ooty</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
    <p>Sitting by the pavements of our campus, we were all excited 
        about the trip we’d planned out – a 3 days visit to Ooty. We 
        all had our phones out, 
        one planning the transport, others calculating the itinerary budget, 
        while I looked for cheap homestays.

        However, upon reaching – our booked stay changed, the car we had 
        digested more fuel, and ultimately, the trip was nothing short of 
        an adventure. This is our experience of Ooty, Tamil Nadu – Ooty travel blog.</p>
    <br>
	<h3>Hues on the Peaks</h3>
    <p>As we drove up the hills of Ooty through the hairpin curves, we couldn’t help but stick
         our heads out of the window. We even stopped at certain points for pictures 
         where the buildings on the slopes added to colorful backdrops.

        Never having visited Ooty before, I couldn’t get enough of the picturesque 
        spot – the simple streets, the narrow curvy roads, and chocolates everywhere we went.</p>
    
	<br>
	<h3>Driving Through Bandipur Tiger Reserve</h3>
    <p>Early at 5 am, I managed to drag myself out of my bed 
        and get ready as we were leaving early. It was a 6 and 
        a half-hour drive from Bangalore and we got all our things
         into the car and on the bike and we began.

        Driving for two hours or so, we had breakfast at a vegetarian 
        restaurant by the road and began our trip again. Renting out a 
        comfortable Innova for our 3 days trip to Ooty was probably the 
        best and most expensive thing 
        on our budget. With its cushiony seats, we didn’t have trouble through the hours.
        
        Besides, the views through the Bandipur Tiger Reserve (also called the Mudumalai r
        eserve from Tamil Nadu) were exciting as we slowly drove through the sanctuary.
         We weren’t allowed to stop inside the reserve so we kept moving with our eyes 
        wide open to catch a glimpse of an exotic breed.</p>

	<h3>Visiting the Ooty Markets</h3>
    <p>It was already late in the evening as we unpacked and
         left our villa again for a tour. So we decided to pay the 
         markets of
         Ooty a visit. I think the market, unlike my assumptions, was the 
         sweetest market I’ve visited.With the plastic ban in Ooty, no junk 
         skims on the roads, coffee shops offer hot chocolates in ceramic mugs
          rather than disposable cups, and the cold makes the smokes of grilled 
          corn makes all the more pleasing.

         Woolen attires including beanies with pom-poms, hot street-side delicacies,
          local chocolates and coffees, and exotic plants are some of the beauties one’s
           bound to see while strolling here.
         
         After a couple of hours of roaming, buying some chocolates, and trying hot coffee,
          we called it a night and returned to our stay.</p>

	<h3>Touring the Town</h3>
    <p>While most of our team woke up lazily as the sun rose, I along with another guy who 
        owned an iPhone (the same guy who drove really well), decided 
        to stroll up the hill we were staying on. We passed by a few local 
        houses, kids playing with firecrackers – yes in the morning, and then… bingo!

        We hit a beautiful offbeat viewpoint towards the end of the path. The 
        road ahead was blocked with the sign ‘Tiger Reservoir ahead, no trespassing 
        allowed. But right before it was a high point overlooking the city down the valley.
        
        With no vehicles and no soul around, we took in the mesmerizing air of the 
        unperturbed wind. Not to mention, we got some amazing shots of the scenery.</p>
    <br>
	 <h3>Doddabetta Peak</h3>
    <p>Returning from the morning viewpoint, we freshened up for the day’s 
        itinerary. We decided to visit the Doddabetta peak point first.

        Since there were many things to see, we planned to see the places
         nearby to any attraction to visit. So heading up the curves of the 
         Doddabetta Peak, we found a chocolate and tea
         factory and put it on our checklist.
        
        Before the Doddabetta point, there was a road intersection with a 
        steep view on one side where people had stopped to take pictures.
         Curious, we stopped here too only to find an amazing view of the tea 
         plantations running down the hills from where we stood.</p>
