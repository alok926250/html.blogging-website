    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Going places-Kashmir</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
    <p>Kashmir is a state located at the top of North India. 
        It is usually in the headlines not because of the 
        spectacular beauty but because of the frequent conflicts 
        happening in the state. As expressed earlier that we, despite 
        of the skeptical nature of our near and dear ones, went to explore 
        Kashmir tourist places and made a Kashmir Tour Blog. Indeed, it was 
        the best thing we did to begin the year 2018 – Shubharam (happy beginning).
         Amidst the blooming fragrances and white snow, Kashmir and its valleys are
          so beautiful. We couldn’t take off our eyes, couldn’t stop smiling looking at 
          the serene destinations in Kashmir. We were internally happy because there was 
          so much love and warmth there. Undoubtedly, the Kashmir tourist places have been
         hidden behind the projected turmoil and we have unhide them with our this Kashmir
          Travel Blog.</p>
    <br>
	<h3>EXPLORING OFFBEAT KASHMIR TOURIST PLACES</h3>
    <p>Kashmir sightseeing is not a usual affair. 
        It is exploring the gifts of nature wrapped at 
        different places in different ways, especially in winters… 
        the time when kangris comes out and power cuts become common. 
        Yes, winters here are quite challenging for the locals. It was a 
        pleasure for us to sample a whole wide range of experiences in Kashmir 
        as we were there for over a week, which we believe is ideal time to explore 
        Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Srinagar. It would be best to stay in Srinagar, the capital
         of Kashmir, for 2-3 days after spending your time in Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sonmarg. 
         Believe me, nothing in the whole wide world looks prettier than Kashmir, all cast 
         in the snow. Alternatively, you can stay in Srinagar first and then go for
          day trips to Gulmarg and Pahalgam. 
        Depends on where you wish to base yourself.</p>
    
	<br>
	<h3>GULMARG, KASHMIR</h3>
    <p>We unwrapped the first gift of nature of Kashmir with our 
        excellent written Kashmir Travel Blog and it was Gulmarg.
         Yes, we drove to Gulmarg the very first day and were utterly 
         amazed to see the snow-covered beauty! It is a no-brainer to
          have Gulmarg on your Kashmir Kashmir Tour Blog itinerary as
           it is the prime hill station to visit during winters. The 
           Gulmarg biosphere reserves, highest peaks, gondola ride are 
           worth the mention. Sit by the window side and while sipping 
           on steaming hot Kahwah just look at the beauty unfolding at 
           every hour of the day. There were a lot of opportunities for 
           skiing and areas for indulging in snow-shmir. Much to our dismay, Phase 2 
        (Gondola goes up to the height of 12293 ft to Aphrawat) wasn’t 
        accessible due to heavy snowfall.</p>

	<br>
	<h3>PAHALGAM, KASHMIR</h3>
    <p>Next, we went to Pahalgam – the Bollywood destination. 
        Pahalgam indeed has a next level charm. It took us about 3 
        hours to reach Pahalgam from Gulmarg. That too because we took 
        a halt at Avantipora to see the ruined temple and then even the 
        Apple Valley. Pahalgam is primarily renowned for its alpine treks,
         nature walks, and lush green grasslands. But during winters, it’s 
         just not the same. With the Liddar river flowing in the middle of 
         the valley (partly frozen actually) and huts on the adjacent side of
          the roads covered with snow – the landscape can leave anyone wonderstruck.
           We went to Aru Valley, did sledging, climbed the mountains covered with
            white blanket and also saw some famous shooting spots as well. Your visit 
            to Pahalgam is incomplete if you don’t go to Betaab Valley! This picturesque 
            spot with snow clad scenic views  was indeed very captivating!
         All we did here was absorb the prettiness.</p>

	<br>
	<h3>SRINAGAR, KASHMIR</h3>
    <p>Known for the oh-so famous Dal lake, this place gave us romantic
         chills in the winter breeze. This city was mesmerisingly beautiful 
         with an old-world charm and a tincture of historic symbols adorned
          all over! Srinagar was engulfed in the local culture, warmth of the 
          natives and sumptuous Kashmiri cuisines. We loved strolling through 
          this city, shopping for crafts like silk and shawls! (yes, I bought a 
          gorgeous pink phiran) The shikara rides, spectacular sunsets  at the boulevard and the
         colourful aura are the unique selling points of this city.</p>
    <br>
	 <h3>BEST TIME TO VISIT KASHMIR</h3>
    <p>We went to Kashmir during the peak winter season when you 
        could see snow-clad mountains, indulge in adventure sports 
        and feel chilly winds coupled with warmth and hospitality of 
        Kashmiris. I have always said there is no best time so the best
         time is NOW! Same way you can explore Kashmir Travel Blog tourist
          places at any time of the year and can see different colours of 
          the state. If you wish to see blossoming gardens, feel the fresh 
          air then March to October are the perfect months for you but if 
          want to play in the snow, go skiing then the 
        peak winter months (November-February) are perfect.</p>
